## React projects with freeCodeCamp

Hi there, in this repository, I practiced around 20+ projects with the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) react projects tutorial on youtbe. The instructor was [John Smliga](https://www.johnsmilga.com/). In this tutorial, I learned and practiced all the basic things of react (like - component, hook, third party package and so on). It helped me to boost up my knowledge in react.
